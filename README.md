# -Image-steganography-using-LSB-Encoding-and-Decoding
This project implements an Image Steganography System using Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding and decoding techniques in the C programming language. It enables secure data hiding and retrieval within BMP image files, preserving the image's visual quality.
## 🔐 Features
- Hide secret messages inside BMP images using LSB encoding.
- Extract hidden messages from stego images using LSB decoding.
- Maintains original image integrity without noticeable changes.
- Bit-level data manipulation using efficient C programming.
- Command-line interface for encoding and decoding.
- Demonstrates strong file handling and image processing skills.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C language**
- **File I/O and bitwise operations**
- **BMP image format**

## 📂 How to Use
1. Compile the project using GCC:
2. Run the program:
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to encode or decode messages.
